## Summary

The Workplace Assessment Tool is an interactive web application designed to help individuals discover their unique learning styles and workplace preferences across four key dimensions: Community and Support Networks, Social and Cultural Learning, Learning Preferences, and Motivation and Problem-Solving. Users complete a series of questions that are then visualized as scatter plots showing their preferences in different quadrants, providing personalized insights and recommendations for workplace accommodations and learning environments.

Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Recharts for data visualization, the tool offers an intuitive user experience with progress tracking, category filtering, and printable results.
